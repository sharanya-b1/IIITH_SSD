# SSD LAB 11: Python

##Assumptions and Working:
1. Python version 3.9.7 is used for all parts
2. No external libraries are used, only inbuilt csv is used for reading the data
3. All actions are performed in a sequential manner and separate functions are given for every task
4. No output is generated on the terminal and only average and stock data output files are written,
   for their respective tasks
5. Only the searching stock data by first character requires user input through the terminal. It
   asks the user for the character to search on. It is noted that this operation only searches through
   the filtered down dataset, filtered during performing the required tasks.
   No headers are given in the output as per the question statement
